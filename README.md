TiddlyWiki plugin for organizing spaced repetitions

## Introduction

SRS allows you to turn your wiki into a spaced repetition system. You create content and organize it, but worry that you might forget it. It's okay to forget things. SRS will help you remember the information that is most important to you without leaving your wiki. You don't need third-party programs to organize spaced repetitions.

## How to install and use SRS

You can find information about installing and using SRS plugin in your wiki on the [demo page](https://tw5-srs.tiddlyhost.com/).
