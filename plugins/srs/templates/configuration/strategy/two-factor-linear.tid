!!! Minimal Step

A minimal repetition period (in seconds) for new and reset cards.

<$edit-text tiddler="$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/minimalStep" tag="input" type="number"/>
<$button actions=<<clearConfiguration "$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/minimalStep">> > Reset </$button>

!!! Short Factor

The multiplier by which the next step is greater than the previous one.
A higher number gives a steeper learning curve.
If repetition is too easy for you, increase the value.
If you often have to reset cards to the beginning, decrease this number.

<$edit-text tiddler="$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/short-factor" tag="input" type="number"/>
<$button actions=<<clearConfiguration "$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/short-factor">> > Reset </$button>

!!! Long Factor Ratio

The divisor is applied when the current step is greater than the pivot value.
A higher number gives a flatter learning curve when the card is in long-term memory.

<$edit-text tiddler="$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/long-factor-ratio" tag="input" type="number"/>
<$button actions=<<clearConfiguration "$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/long-factor-ratio">> > Reset </$button>

!!! Pivot Value

The value of a repetition period (in seconds) after which the long factor ratio is applied.
It equals to 1 day by default.

<$edit-text tiddler="$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/pivot" tag="input" type="number"/>
<$button actions=<<clearConfiguration "$:/config/midorum/srs/scheduling/two-factor-linear/pivot">> > Reset </$button>
